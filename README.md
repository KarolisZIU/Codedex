# 🧙‍♂️ Hogwarts House Sorting Quiz

Welcome to the **Hogwarts House Sorting Quiz**!  
This is a simple, text-based quiz written in Python that sorts a user into one of the four Hogwarts houses based on their answers to a few personality-driven questions.
  
## 📜 Description

- 🦁 **Gryffindor**

At the end of the quiz, it prints the score for each house — you can interpret the house with the highest score as your ideal match!
